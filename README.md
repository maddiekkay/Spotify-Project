# Spotify-Project

The purpose of this project is to collect data about all of my saved songs.

### my_saved_tracks.csv

A dataframe of my saved tracks and their audio features, scraped using the Spotify API.

### spotify scrape.ipynb

A jupyter notebook that walks through how I scraped the information for my saved tracks from Spotify.

### clientspotify.txt // secretspotify.txt

Files with sensitive information that aren't included in the repository. These will need to be recreated on your own machine.
